# Tests

Basic tests for board provided by the Octopi Driver Stack

## Background

This directory contains unit tests for board provided by ODSv1.0.0. These tests are just for verification of basic functionalities to confirm that the board was designed and assembled correctly, and are roughly equivalent to example sketches provided by the Arduino IDE. These tests are implemented as Arduino sketches, and manual action is needed to follow test procedures.

## Usage

Test procedures and usage instructions for each test are provided by the README.md files in each subdirectory of this directory.
